                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Taki has long, straight mauve-toned dark brown hair tucked behind her ears, with long bangs that
                        drift to her left and reach her eyes. She has sharp, almond-shaped pinkish-purple eyes, thin
                        arched
                        brows, and a mole under the corner of her left eye.</p>
                    <p>Her original band outfit consisted of a white jacket with pockets on each side and blue
                        horizontal
                        stripes on each sleeve, worn over a black top and a black button-down skirt, which is held up by
                        a
                        chartreuse yellow belt. She wears black shoes with chartreuse yellow laces.</p>
                    <p>In her casual outfit, she wears a black shirt with a white coat over it, a denim miniskirt with a
                        brown belt around it, and black sneakers. She also wears a triangular earring on her right ear.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Taki lives together with her sister Maki, who is 4 years older than her. When Maki was in high
                        school, she was the president of Haneoka Girls' High School's brass band and at the same time,
                        one of the trumpet players of the local orchestra which frequently participates and wins in
                        competitions. She currently attends university and is still part of said orchestra.</p>
                    <p>Taki used to attend Haneoka's middle school branch. Like Maki, she too used to play the trumpet
                        in her school's brass band. Due to certain circumstances, she had to switch to Hanasakigawa in
                        high school.</p>
                    <p>Taki was also the drummer of <a href="terminology.html#crychic"
                            class="terminology-link">CRYCHIC</a>, and by the recommendation of her older sister, was
                        invited
                        to join the band by Sakiko. Even though she isn't good at customer service, after the band's
                        disbandment, Taki started working part-time at RiNG as a staff member in order to learn more
                        about bands. She also started studying how to compose DTM (Desktop music) around the same time.

            <div class="personality-section">
                <div class="personality-text">
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>In contrast to her cool appearance, Taki is a very serious, reactive, and diligent girl who
                        enjoys being all alone. Her blunt personality, short temper, and tendency to glare at people
                        make her out to be unfriendly. Though, beneath her harsh exterior, Taki is actually a very
                        earnest and emotional person who is well-aware of her own shortcomings. She secretly cares
                        deeply about others, but has difficulty expressing it. She seems the happiest and most at peace
                        when performing onstage.</p>
                    <p>Taki is very passionate about music. Despite being a big fan of Afterglow, a band acknowledged
                        for their imperfect yet blazingly passionate performances, because of her inferiority complex
                        towards her older sister and Sakiko who are naturally gifted, with MyGO!!!!! she strives to "do
                        things properly" by herself so much to the point that she even snapped once just at being
                        offered help, because she thought the notion implied that she wasn't reliable enough. As
                        mentioned by Tsugumi, Taki also has a habit of focusing on what she can't do rather than the
                        other way around. It is normal for her to neglect her health because of how often she overworks
                        herself composing music or stressing over the band, leading her to fall asleep during class or
                        to skip school. Taki also scolds her fellow members (except for Tomori) when they fail to meet
                        her standards.</p>
                    <p>Taki considers Tomori very, if not the most important person to her. She values her thoughts and
                        feelings more than anyone else's, including her own. Because she tends to feel inferior to
                        people such as her older sister and Sakiko, who, unlike her, possess charisma and exceptional
                        talent, the vulnerability and therefore "imperfection" reflected in Tomori's lyrics brought Taki
                        to tears and made her realize "it's alright for someone like me to be alive." Unfortunately, due
                        to Taki's guardedness, she struggles to convey the weight of her feelings to Tomori, showing her
                        affection through protectiveness and extreme devotion instead. Until recently, she also didn't
                        think that it was proper to want to perform with Tomori as she felt it was just her "selfish
                        desire".</p>
                    <p>Taki displays a bit of antisocial behavior— she often chooses to spend time alone at places
                        usually visited with many people (such as karaoke and bathhouses) not only because of her
                        dislike of social interaction, but also because she "doesn't think she's been anywhere alone",
                        implying that she was always together with someone in the past. Taki is very secretive and
                        defensive about this, being quick to switch locations on the off chance she is spotted. She
                        seems to be quite ashamed of her other hobbies and interests asides from music, even lying about
                        trivial things such as her food preferences. She is deeply fond of pandas.</p>
