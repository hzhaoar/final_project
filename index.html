                On July 4, 2024, BanG Dream!'s producer Nemoto Yuuki released a statement explaining that MyGO!!!!! will
                not be receiving any full-band events in Girls Band Party! until Spring 2025, as their "story is
                intended to first develop through the compilation movies and BanG Dream! Ave Mujica", however they are
                not entirely neglected as they will appear in various Mixed events starting from Fall 2024.

                A girls band formed by five members who are determined to move forward, even as the lost. They stand on

                After transferring to Haneoka Girls' High School before the start of Golden Week, <a href="anon.html"
                    class="member-link anon">Anon</a> noticed that many students at the school were forming bands, which
                inspired her need to form one herself. She ends up meeting "Haneoka's Weirdo Girl" <a href="tomori.html"
                    class="member-link tomori">Tomori</a>, the vocalist of the now disbanded CRYCHIC, along with <a
                    href="taki.html" class="member-link taki">Taki</a>, the drummer of the same band. At RiNG, Anon ends
                up meeting with <a href="soyo.html" class="member-link soyo">Soyo</a>, who seemed to have sparked an
                interest when Anon mentioned Tomori to her, due to her still being distraught after the disbanding of
                CRYCHIC. The four girls ended up forming a band, later adding <a href="rana.html"
                    class="member-link rana">Raana</a> onto the list of members, which completed their "band of lost
                girls".

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Their band name "MyGO!!!!!" is a play on the Japanese word "maigo". It literally means lost
                child/children.
                It is also a pun in two languages. In English, it references the phrase "My go," which is a way of
                saying "my turn." The title for their band story It's MyGO!!!!! is a play on this phrase.
                Most of MyGO!!!!!'s song titles are in gikun, kanji with a special reading.
                Similar to Poppin'Party, the initials of the members, excluding the vocalist, can form the word "STAR".
                If the vocalist's initial is included, it can form the word "START".
                If the vocalist's name meaning ("light") is included, their names can create the word "Starlight".
                Anon was the only member who had no experience with her instrument prior to MyGO!!!!!'s formation.
                MyGO!!!!!'s character designs were done by Ueta Kazuyuki and their original character illustrations were
                done by Shuzuku.
                Ueta was in-charge of the character designs for the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the anime, as well as for the
                Episode of Roselia movies, FILM LIVE 2nd Stage, and the Girls Band Party! 5th Anniversary Animation.
                They had their very own anime announced on April 9, 2023. It began airing on June 29, 2023.
                Their family names (Takamatsu, Chihaya, Kaname, Nagasaki and Shiina) are all based on the names of areas
                in Toshima.
