                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Raana has short, wavy, grayish-white hair that falls just above her shoulders. Her left eye is
                        steel blue and her right eye is yellow.</p>
                    <p>Her original band outfit consists of a sleeveless black turtleneck top with a chartreuse yellow
                        zipper on the collar, an oversized white jacket that is blue on the inside, black leggings with
                        thin white stripes on each side, and black shoes with laces that are the same yellow as her
                        zipper.</p>
                    <p>In her casual outfit, she wears a white long-sleeved, off-the-shoulder T-shirt dress underneath a
                        slightly shorter-sleeved black shirt that's ripped along the bottom hem.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Raana was born to her mother Utai and father Tsuyoshi. She is also the granddaughter of
                        Tsuzuki Shifune. Her guitar is a hand-me-down from her grandmother, specifically the guitar she
                        used while performing as Shisen. She would hang out at SPACE every day playing the guitar,
                        however after its closing, Raana felt that she had lost the place where she belongs to. Later
                        on, Raana started frequently playing at RiNG and would also try practicing with other bands,
                        however, she never stayed long with any of them as she would quickly lose interest.</p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Raana is an eccentric girl. She is a very talented guitarist who also has a very frank
                        personality, as she always states what she likes and doesn't like. As shown in multiple "Daily
                        Life of MyGO!!!!!" shorts, she is somewhat of a glutton and loves sweets, especially parfaits,
                        but also dislikes hot foods as she has a sensitive tongue.</p>
                    <p>Taki has dubbed her "RiNG's stray cat" due to her whimsical nature. She arrives to and leaves
                        practice when she feels like it and even does things like staying at school until evening to
                        play with stray cats. She can be easily persuaded through snacks and especially with anything
                        matcha-flavored. She abruptly joins MyGO!!!!! by herself because she thinks Tomori is a "very
                        interesting woman". After being scolded about it by Ririko, she started calling Tomori and the
                        others "interesting girls" instead.</p>
                    <p>Raana eventually mentions that after SPACE closed down, she felt like she was suffocating - as
                        she considers playing the guitar as natural as breathing - but after meeting Tomori and joining
                        the band, she "started having an easier time breathing again."</p>
