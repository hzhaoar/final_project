                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Soyo has long, waist-length light brown hair and grayish-blue eyes, often supporting a gentle
                        expression on her face.</p>
                    <p>Her original band outfit consisted of a white turtleneck sweater with black cuffs, a black belt
                        with a silver buckle, and a deep blue skirt with a long outer mesh layer. Her shoes are black
                        with a chartreuse yellow cross on each.</p>
                    <p>In her casual outfit, she wears a white blouse with short, puffy sleeves and a frilly neckline, a
                        cream-colored skirt with small flower patterns, and a thin brown necklace with a star charm on
                        it.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Soyo was born as Ichinose Soyo. While in elementary school, she moved out with her mother
                        and adapted her mother's surname, Nagasaki. Due to her mother being busy with her work, Soyo had
                        to spend a considerable amount of time alone.</p>
                    <p>Soyo was the bassist of CRYCHIC. She met Sakiko when the latter approached her after a brass
                        band's concert that Soyo played in.</p>
                    <p>Though she is good at hiding it, the band's disbandment actually hit Soyo hard, as she not only
                        had taken Sakiko's words about peoples' fates being one when they're in a band together
                        literally, but also because she couldn't understand why they should break up when they were
                        having so much fun every day. She also felt that it was one of the first things she had done out
                        of her own will, as she started attending Tsukinomori out of her mother's insistence and joined
                        the brass band only because her classmates did the same.</p>
                    <p>After the girls started high school, Soyo started becoming more desperate, leading to her
                        attempting to contact Sakiko multiple times afterwards because she wanted the band to start
                        over.</p>

        <div id="personality" class="personality-container">
            <div class="personality-section">
                <div class="personality-text">
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Soyo is a very kind and mature girl and she is often compared to an older sister or a caring
                        mother. Due to this, she is often relied on by her peers, who she occasionally offers advice to.
                        Soyo has a habit of fiddling with her fingertips when she's thinking or planning something.
                        Although not outwardly hostile, Soyo can be quite cunning at times.</p>
                    <p>Deep down, Soyo has a hard time letting go of the past and moving forward, especially in regards
                        to her former band. A part of her selfishly clung to the idea that CRYCHIC still hadn't actually
                        broken up, as shown in the way she reacted after MyGO!!!!! decided to play Haruhikage during
                        their first concert. As Sakiko kept rejecting her attempts to revive the band, Soyo cried that
                        she had worked so hard for CRYCHIC, and even claimed that she is willing to do anything for the
                        former. In reality all of this stemmed from her not wanting to be left all alone.</p>
                    <p>After revealing her true nature and reuniting with her band, while still retaining her gentle
                        outlook, Soyo started expressing herself more bluntly and even admits to Tomori that she had
                        always felt at unease with Tomori's lyrics due to resonating with them, as well as how there's a
                        possibility she'll never be able to forget about CRYCHIC. She also mentions how she feels like a
                        hypocrite for being desperate to be accepted by everyone around her and acting the way she is at
                        school, being nice and getting along with everyone, while in reality deep down being a
                        self-centered person.</p>
