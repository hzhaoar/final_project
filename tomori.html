                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Tomori was born to mother Hikari and father Yoshiji.</p>
                    <p>Ever since she was young, Tomori had felt like she didn't belong anywhere, and had difficulty
                        making friends due to her awkward personality. She thought that she was always a step behind
                        everyone else.</p>
                    <p>In middle school, specifically in her 3rd year, Tomori was invited to form a band by Sakiko after
                        a chance meeting with the latter. This led to her forming a band called CRYCHIC together with
                        Mutsumi, Sakiko, Soyo, and Taki and she acted as their vocalist and lyricist. However, after
                        their first and only live performance, the band broke up, leaving Tomori in a distraught and
                        broken state, and she kept blaming herself for the band's breakup.</p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Tomori is a kind but sensitive girl who, as mentioned above, has an awkward personality. She has
                        a tendency to stutter while talking and not make eye contact. She also tends to blame herself
                        for the conflicts that happen around her, even if they weren't caused by her.</p>
                    <p>She is infamously known as "Haneoka's Weirdo Girl" due to her peculiar personality. She likes
                        collecting all sorts of things, such as band-aids (especially ones with animals such as pandas
                        or penguins on them), slippery things, just-the-right-size things, and even rocks and fallen
                        leaves that she picks up from the ground. She also likes pill bugs and has been shown often
                        drawing them in her notebooks.</p>
