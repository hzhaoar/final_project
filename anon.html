                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Anon is someone of average height and has light gray eyes and long, waist-length pink hair. She
                        sometimes wears glasses, especially at home.</p>
                    <p>Her original band outfit is a black dress with two vertical blue stripes on each side. The
                        sleeves are mesh, and each cuff has a chartreuse yellow ribbon tied on it. She wears this dress
                        with a black belt, silver buckle, and black lace-up boots with blue shoelaces.</p>
                    <p>In her casual outfit, she wears a sleeveless gray plaid dress over a long-sleeved white blouse.
                        The dress has a similarly patterned belt around the middle with a black buckle. She also wears a
                        necklace with a heart charm on it.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>When Anon was in middle school, she was the student council president and was known as a popular
                        and talented girl, however she had no close friends and everyone referred to her with her last
                        name. Due to the aforementioned facts, her schoolmates would constantly put her on a pedestal.
                        Near the end of ninth grade, she had expressed an interest in attending a high school in England
                        as a foreign exchange student. However, while there, she realized how inferior she was in
                        contrast to everyone, and she was also very bothered by the fact that everybody, including
                        teachers, referred to her as "Ann" and not Anon. This then led to her moving back to Japan and
                        transferring into Haneoka at an odd time.</p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Anon is an honor student who is very social and also assertive at the same time. Despite this, it
                        is shown that she has had a hard time making friends. Anon also loves following and trying out
                        the newest trends. She approaches Tomori after learning about her in hopes of creating a band
                        together with her.</p>
                    <p>Although she initially created the band in order to gain attention, to the point where she wanted
                        to name the band after herself, she ends up becoming dedicated to her band activities and taking
                        practicing seriously.</p>
                    <p>Anon often tries taking the position of the band's leader, however her ideas tend to be shrugged
                        off (mainly by Taki and Soyo) or receive little to no response or encouragement.</p>
